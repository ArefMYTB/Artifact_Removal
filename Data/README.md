We introduce a bran new dataset called DHI which is short for Distorted Human Image.

Structure:

├── 1 ├── Distorted -- Mask -- Flawless -- Reference

├── 2

├── ...

└── n

Mask & Reference images may be more than one image.(e.g. Mask_1 -- Mask_2)

Flawless consistently represents the non-defective version of the distorted image across all dataset.

Reference images are same person but in different pose or clothes.
