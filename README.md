## Abstract
In this paper, we propose a novel conditional inpainting method designed to tackle the artifact removal problem in virtual try-on (VTON) and pose transfer tasks. Our approach effectively restores image quality and continuity by generating context-aware image completions, offering significant improvements over existing methods.

## Key Features
- Implementation of the proposed artifact removal pipeline.
- Pretrained models for artifact removal on VTON and pose transfer tasks.
- Scripts for dataset preparation, model training, and inference.

## Inference
You can test it in [Demo](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sea7gad2rED0nKJn0s7D7Z_o1aZd6L7X?usp=sharing)

## Results
